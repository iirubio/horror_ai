After the... well somewhat shifty scripts to be produced for the first prequels, I had become skeptical that anything could be done to redeem the Star Wars Empire. I have not yet seen the film, but if this script is any indication, it should be quite the excellent film.  The drama was woven exceptionally well with excellent dialogue, and for the most part, there were not many wasted scenes, as I found there to be in the earlier films. It harkens back to "The Empire Strikes Back", my personal favorite of all the SW films. There might be perhaps a bit too much gratuitous violence, but that will have to wait to be seen when I venture out to view the film on the screen (Which I shall be doing quite soon)

Thank you George Lucas, you have restored my faith in thee, and your intricately woven Star Wars Universe. </p><hr/><p><b>Andy Skillman</b> <a href="mailto:hurleyboy714@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/1-stars.gif"/> (1 out of 10 )<br/>I am gonna puke. Lucas must die. Thank heaves that this so called "series of GREAT movies" is OVER! Star Wars fans are total nerds. Emo and DDR for life!</p><hr/><p><b>Eric Hoppus</b> <a href="mailto:b.a.barracus@juno.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/2-stars.gif"/> (2 out of 10 )<br/>you should have saved all your crap ideas for "star trek" you fat bastige! this movie was only saved by the fact that the girl sitting in front of me was completely topless! </p><hr/><p><b>John Aldrich</b> <a href="mailto:jaldrich2k4@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/6-stars.gif"/> (6 out of 10 )<br/>dialog seems a bit too stale for the story that needs to be told, plus there are some lines from the trailers that are missing in this version.  it's possible that those changes were made in mid-production, or possible that this could be a fake.  Guess I'll know once I see the movie.</p><hr/><p><b>jen</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>well, i read this after seeing the movie and i loved the movie and the script!  Star Wars is amazing and this has become my new favorite movie, Star Wars or otherwise!  the best scene when you watch it on screen is when obi wan is yelling to anakin about loving him, and how in the world could he have turned to the dark side! </p><hr/><p><b>Dr. Hermann</b> <a href="mailto:praetorian52@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>A mi me parecio excelente pelicula, la vi el dia del estreno y creo que tiene todo lo necesario para triunfar como los otros episodios.

I still couldn't stop reading it. I love Star Wars, and i love how this episode turned out.</p><hr/><p><b>Master Obi-Wan</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Great movie, great script (why did Lucas cut out the Qui-Gon scene?!)
Best of the Prequels and maybe the best Star Wars movie ever!</p><hr/><p><b>Undecided</b> <img src="/images/rating/8-stars.gif"/> (8 out of 10 )<br/>
*** possible SPOILER ***

Is this really the EXACT same script from the version in theaters?  At the end of the movie, while Yoda is trying to meditate, I do not remember Yoda talking to Qui-Gon right before Bail Organa comes in.

</p><hr/><p><b>PK</b> <img src="/images/rating/9-stars.gif"/> (9 out of 10 )<br/>This isn't the exact same script.  Some scenes appear to have been edited out.  Some dialogue during the opening battle, and most scenes involving Mon Mothma and Bail Organa seem to have disappeared, as has the Qui-Gon scene</p><hr/><p><b>me</b> <img src="/images/rating/1-stars.gif"/> (1 out of 10 )<br/>He can't write. (He also can't direct, but that's not relevant in talking about the script.) He shows actual disdain for logic and the reality of the universe he's created. (example: newly turned Sith Lord Vader marches up to the Jedi temple with 1000 clones behind him and the Jedi don't sense him coming?)</p><hr/><p><b>An</b> <img src="/images/rating/6-stars.gif"/> (6 out of 10 )<br/>I'd have to say that the special effects and action bits (more than bits seeing as that was the whole movie practically...o_O) were *amazing*. George Lucus has a definate talent with the camera and shot selection as well as being able to build up the tension and excitement. Dialogue was seriously lacking and most of the time a bit cheesy..</p><hr/><p><b>george</b> <a href="mailto:alain18@123mail.cl" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>great movie,it makes a great conection with episode IV but some scenes from this script were edited out.this movie was kind of more sad than the other 5,i mean,i never felt anything even close to sadness during the other 5 episodes</p><hr/><p><b>Tyrell</b> <a href="mailto:turtleguyntc@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>The movie is awsome </p><hr/><p><b>Obi-Wan's fan</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Very, very, very ,very, very, very ,very, very, very ,very, very, very ,very, very, very ,very, very, very ,very, very, very ,very good :) !

It's a pity that the scene with Yoda and Qui-Gon was cut :( !

P.S :I hope that my English is correct, I am French ;) !</p><hr/><p><b>shannon</b> <a href="mailto:shannoncote2003@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/> wow  GREAT read . can't wait 2 see the flim ........</p><hr/><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src="/images/rating/8-stars.gif"/> (8 out of 10 )<br/>I thought this joining movie really tied together some mysteries, for example, why the twins were separated at birth, and why Darth Vader required the whole suit.  It was full of sadness, love, passion, compassion, remorse, death and new life.  The only reason I marked it lower than 9 or ten was that I found Padme (Nattelie Portman) in the movie was much, much weaker.  I know she was pregnant and all, but girl, you gotta show some backbone.  And Nattelie Portman plays such a good strong female role, it was upsetting to see Padme now so weak and helpless.  That is all, and may the force be with you.  </p><hr/><p><b>Luke</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Let's hope, on DVD some of this politics part from the script will be present... </p><hr/><p><b>Steven</b> <img src="/images/rating/2-stars.gif"/> (2 out of 10 )<br/>I wish I could say I liked it, but George Lucas is an abysmal writer. He was wise to bring in other screenwriters for "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi," and he was a fool not to do so for each of his prequels. This script contains some of the most pedestrian and inane dialogue I've ever heard: "He's worried about you. He thinks you're under too much stress." Give me a break! Lucas is incredibly creative and develops compelling and fantastic stories, but day-time soap operas have better dialogue.</p><hr/><p><b>Pat!</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>The movie rocked and so did this script.

I only hope that all the scenes that got cut from the final movie make it onto the DVD special features. :)</p><hr/><p><b>Draghi</b> <a href="mailto:leonardodraghiew@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>The special effects, they are fantastics, whole is good, the story, the cast, the song... I love this film, its excellent, really.</p><hr/><p><b>MC Jesus</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>The best movie ever!I can't get enough!Much better than LotR!Everyone who's rating is 7 or less:You don't have a good taste or you suxxxx!</p><hr/><p><b>sonya</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>This movie is so amazing. And a lot of the dialogs from this movie is amazing almost the movie. Simply I love it.</p><hr/><p><b>Darth Yulivee</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Well I think ROTS is just the best movie ever!! I love Star Wars, the Prequels and the original movies, and I wish it hadn't been the last episode...</p><hr/><p><b>Master Jedi Jules</b> <img src="/images/rating/9-stars.gif"/> (9 out of 10 )<br/>
This movie is Super Fly TNT -  that's all you had to say!

Did you see the size of his light saber - it was bigger than him! It's a miracle - I believe god came down from heaven and stopped those laser blasts. I'm giving up the life and walking the streets.</p><hr/><p><b>Yoghurt</b> <img src="/images/rating/3-stars.gif"/> (3 out of 10 )<br/>All the prequels suxxxs. thought Lucas was a good director but he proved that I was wrong. Impires strikes back and Return of the Jedi have been perfect screened entertainment and will be. Lucas destroyed his own work in directing the prequels. He should have let Spielberg or other (better than him) done it. I am dissapointed. What a pity. </p><hr/><p><b>Cole</b> <img src="/images/rating/9-stars.gif"/> (9 out of 10 )<br/>Awesome. I really loved it. Anyone that's knocking this movie has no taste. Sure, the script is a little bit.. flimsy in places but it is far better than the other prequels by a long shot. I love Mustafar scene before Anakin and Obi fight, the "You're a good person, don't do this" and the like. Very good. Can't wait for the DVD, and hopefully Lucas you fag. IF YOU BY SOME CHANCE READ THIS. INCLUDE ALL THE DELETED SCENES AS PART OF THE MOVIE. Ep II could have been so much better if you kept Padmes family in it. Clown.</p><hr/><p><b>Chris</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>i thought the film and script were excellent.  who ever thought it was crap, id lke 2 c u make a film that rakes in as much money as these six.  some of the scenes in the script were cut out though. why? like wen yoda goes in his pod 2 dagobah. i dont remember seeing that in the film and i saw it yesterday so.......</p><hr/><p><b>Darth A</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>I loved all the films, but this is definitely the very best! The part of Anakin inadvertently bringing about the very thing he wants to avoid - losing Padme - has a quality of an Ancient Greek tragedy about it. I was deeply moved. Yes, please include the deleted scenes on the DVD (for which I am now passionately waiting). Thank you George Lucas for such a fine movie and shame over all those senseless fellows bashing it without reason.</p><hr/><p><b>Aston Jor-Cello</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Just finished reading the script, and even though I have seen the actual film 5 times since the release, the script still touches me the same way the movie does.  As I read, in my mind I can still replay the exact scenes as they are dipicted on the the screen.  Wonderful script, wonderful movie.  I can't wait for the DVD, hopefully all these deleted scenes will make an appearance.  Keep up the good work George Lucas, thank you for bringing the Star Wars galaxy here to our galaxy, where it will live on forever in our hearts and in our spirits, and will never die. Thank you, and may the Force be with you.   </p><hr/><p><b>Darth Incredulous</b> <img src="/images/rating/3-stars.gif"/> (3 out of 10 )<br/>Really, the writing is so staggeringly awful as to almost defy belief! The Sunday Times culture magazine rearranged the letters of the word Shit, for the headline 'Sith Happens' and nothing could be more appropriate.  
Like any bloke in their mid 20s I absolutely adore the original three films. And even though the poor quality of those scripts was summarised perfectly by Harrison Ford - "George, you can write this shit but you can't say it," they were at least a heap load of fun.

This film is mind blowing and dare I venture further, the best out of all six.  I do have a few comments for the twits whose lack of faith is disturbing.      (I)  MR  HOPPUS: Speaking on behalf of the fairer sex, I predict that sitting one row in back of that toppless girl in a dark theatre (or theater, as you prefer)  is as close as you will ever get to a half naked female (human female.)  Advice: Keep tossing sweetheart.       (II) MR SKILLMAN: Dungeon Master says "PSYCHOPATH" Not to worry though, there are  clinics and hotlines (free ones, not those 1-900 numbers you are use to dialling) for people like you. Get some help and perhaps a little perspective.     (III)  ME:  "ME"  is it?  Either (1) you are not aware that "ME" is an objective  pronoun and your dazzling display of ignorance is a reflection of the general decline of the American (or British ) education system or  (2) you are one of those souless Durkheimian droids whose Mommy (or  Mummy)  overindulged at the toy store, as your fat little hands wailed in the air to your crys of "ME, ME, ME and more, more, more". Whatever the case maybe for your choice of alias,  allow me  if you will to indulge your over inflated sense of self and quote you.   "... not relevant in 'talking' about the script."   Sir/ Madame,  I implore you,  master grammer first and let your simple mind save the quest for logic to others more adept and ready for the task.  Allow me to point out that when one is "writing" ( as you were so feebily attempting to do) they are not "talking".      (IV))  DARTH INCREDULOUS:  The Sunday Times? Really?  Are you seriously quoting from a Newspaper that once employed on its roster of writers the likes of Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.  If I subscribed to that TORY RAG, I  would cetaintly keep it a secret.  "Be mindful of your thoughts  young  "20-something bloke "  they betray you as the 68 year old  conservative pensioner that you truly are.  I suppose the good news is that the LONDON TIMES newspaper will eventually cease to print once Michael Howard or whatever facist they next elect, completes the party mission to render itself irrelvant and into the history books, simultaneously wiping out  the TIMES fan base and thus leaving gits like you to hours of banal reality television viewing for your info/enterainment.    (V)STEVEN:  I quote you in your critique of Mr. Lucas' choice of dialogue "Give me a break!"  You open your Freshman Basic Composition 101 insight to criticise Lucas' dialogue and you offer up to the world the ever original narrative  "Give me a break!"  Are you a "Valley girl?"   (VI) YOGHURT:  Is Mr Lucas or anyone for that matter, really  suppose to take advise  or criticism form a person who chooses a dairy product as an alias?

I laughed at parts and I cried from the middle to the end.  I have never seen another movie that has made me do both.  Lucas can write!  Wow!  I was blown away.  He put so much into this movie and connected everything just perfectly.  It couldn't have been written any better.  It was so good, I had to go see it once more.  Anakin's fall to the Dark Side was perfect.  Many people say it happened way to fast.  But if your husband/wife was going to die, and you only had one way to save her/him, you'd probably do it- not matter what it was.  Plus, the Chancellor was pulling him in, making it sounded like he related to Anakin's problems.  I think the time plot was perfect.  I don't care what others say- this movie kicked butt, made me cry, laugh, blew me away, and made me go back for the second time.  I  can't wait for it to come out on DVD!

It was action-packed, but so emotional, as well.  I cried, also, MrsKenobi.  So sad.  But perfect.  I read the movie-based books and I read the 3rd one last night.  I cried when I read it because it's just so powerful and emotional.  Great film!  </p><hr/><p><b>AlmostPerfect</b> <img src="/images/rating/9-stars.gif"/> (9 out of 10 )<br/>Great script. I wish they included the deleted scenes...

To whoever said Anakin's ONLY reason for turning to the dark side was to not lose Padme is mistaken.

i) He repeatedly said how he was limited by the Jedi. They didn't see his "true" potential (actually they did...they just didn't want to pump his ego too much). The chancellor played pride of Anakin's to a tee.

ii) He wanted more power. He wanted to be the greatest Jedi there ever was...and eventually that thirst for power turns to the dark side.

iii) He specifically to Padme that hey...I can kill the chancellor, and we'll rule the galaxy together. Case in point...Padme was not the only reason, power was also one.

And that need for power came out of the fact that he just wanted to be recognized. As soon as someone paid attention to him (i.e. Palpatine), he would be fooled into blindly trusting.

Yes, Padme did have a huge effect on him. But never just look at the surface, within that desire for Padme to live was desire for other things.

As well, Palpatine was so good at fooling people, at wieving webs of lies so deep that you couldn't tell light from darkness. Another reason why Anakin eventually fell to the dark side.

Anyway, I liked it. Definitely liked how it all leads into the first episode again (and by first I mean the original order). I especially loved that scene in the end...both Anakin and Padme are on the operating table. One operation sustains and in effect creates Darth Vader (and I mean the REAL darth vader...he wasn't vader unti lthat mask was on :P).

The other operation gives birth to the "New Hope", i.e. Luke and Leah. Oh...and now we know Luke is older haha...

So many things I personally would have changed...but that's just to fit my own imagination and likings, just as Lucas told the story he wanted to tell and I think he did a great job of that. If anyone doesn't like the story...well ok, think up of a better one.

Aidee, you really come across like some sort of Games Workshop loitering, comic book collecting, Star Wars merchandise hoarding, 
sad, masturbating, wolly minded liberal. Why else would you rant on and on at detractors of the Star Wars movie, all of whom are perfectly entitled to their opinions? As for your obvious disdain for that Tory rag, The Sunday Times, is there any particular reason why eloquent, witty, intelligent writing puts such a bee in your bonnet. I dont recall ever reading anything to do with politics at all in the culture magazine, that so beautifully trounced that complete cowpat of a film with words.

I was disapponited with the transformation of Anakin to Darth. We were led to believe that Anakin wiped out the Jedi, when in fact all he did was slaughter the children. 

There was no evidence of Anakin's fear anger and hate making him any stronger at all and, as it turns out, the only battle he has with a Jedi (Obi-Wan) he loses. All the other Darths would have kicked his arse too!

Also, are we expected to believe that the Darth helmet deepens Anakins voice from the high-pitched, balls havent dropped yet tones of a pretty boy teenager, to the booming, black man, juggernaut tones of James Earl Jones? Very strange. 

Oh and because he loses his legs at the end, we must all assume that's the reason he stands at about 7ft tall in the original trilogy.

While I didn't care much for the acting or the script it's still Star Wars. I am deeply disappointed that we didn't see the birth of the most powerful and ruthless Jedi ofall time...one who, through sheer force of hatred, would cut down every Jedi himself.

And what does it say for the power of the fabled Jedi with their lightniing reflexes and sixth sense, that they are so feebly gunned down by crappy Clone troppers? 

I got no sense of power from the 'powerful' in this film. If Anakin was a prophesy, a figure fortold in the cod-bilbical texts of the Jedi, why does he kill defenceless children in Episodes 2 and 3 and get his arse smacked by Ewan at the end?  </p><hr/><p><b>Death2Emo's</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Excellent script.

It was the best out of the 6.
</p><hr/><p><b>Snaitf</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Man, I've read the book twice and seen the movie 6 times and it's still awesome! I love the references to the novel. Very nice. It's just too bad that the Qui-Gon scene was cut from the movie.. :( ah, maybe it will be a deleted scene... 

and ya'll, unless you understand the plot, don't flame this. I mean, Simon (Not meaning to rag on you, BTW), Anakin did not only kill all the Younglings, he killed every Jedi in the temple as well, regardless of whether he had clone help or not, which would be, if you count all Younglings too young for missions, Padawans without Masters, Masters without Padawans that are not fighting, and everyone else in between, would probably be roughly 1000-2000 Jedi. And you can't forget that he and Obi-Wan have been in fighting almost every battle together for the past 3 years They have taught each other new tricks and know each other's secrets. That's why, even though Anakin is a lot stronger Midichlorian-wise (Obi-Wan's Midichlorian count is only 13,500 and Anakin's is I think 23,400), Obi-Wan is able to hold out against him until he sees and advantage (i.e. the hill by the lava)

His lungs were burned away to uselessness when he was burned alive by the lava. (Heehee look at him burn... oh, sorry ^_^) He cannot breathe or talk on his own except in a controlled environment (Thus we see him in ESB in that little black and white sphere thing with his helmet off) So, in essence, the vocabulator talks for him. He THINKS of what he wants to say the the vocabulator actually does the talking. What you hear in Ep. 4-6 is not his real voice, except when Luke takes the mask off.

The Prophesy of the Chosen One... that's a little harder to explain as there are so many different theories I've seen on the internet... I'll try though... all right, the reason the Chosen One turned to the Dark side and contradicted the Prophesy could be 1.) The prophesy was misread. That's an easy one because there's even a quote from Yoda speculating in Ep.3. 2.) The Prophesy never specified HOW the bringing of balance to the Force. The Jedi just did not expect it to come around the way it did, but Anakin in essence did destroy the Sith in Ep. 6. 3.) the Prophesy was intentionally misleading because it was planted by a Sith lord in the Jedi Order during the Sith War... that one I made up completely... ^_^;; Wow, I must be bored/hyper. Bad combination...

And as for the 6th sense bit, all I can say in there favor is that Darth Sidious was making the Dark side cloud their senses. You can get that much from dialogue between Master Windu and Yoda in Ep.2: "Blind we are, if the creation of this clone army, we did not see."
"I think it's time we tell the senate that our ability to use the Force has been diminished"
"Only the Dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If told, the Senate is, multiply our adversaries will."
Wow... I actually remembered all that... I haven't seen Ep. 2 in like a year... Wait... ranting... got it! ^_^

Well, now that I've done that there's nothing to do... it's times like this when I wish my mom's laptop had WoW...

Why does Leia remeber her mother,and Luke doesn't, Yoda didn't train Obi-Wan as a Padawan, there are a few other things I could mention) and the script was well written, if you watch the first two Episodes you know the third can not have a happy ending.  I think the tragedy of how Anakin becomes Vader was very well played out, all the Actors did an amazing job (although I wasn't to fond of Natalie Portman's acting until Episode 2).  George Lucas is a very talented writer and Director, and for those of you who didn't like it, I'm sure he's done other movies that you would like...besides, you have to be seriously disturbed to not like starwars.</p><hr/><p><b>brett</b> <a href="mailto:crystal_myth28@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>best movie ever</p><hr/><p><b>yorka</b> <img src="/images/rating/5-stars.gif"/> (5 out of 10 )<br/>Hmmm... worst star wars movie ever... too much ridicolous scenes and stuff</p><hr/><p><b>Lvader</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>that was the best one of them all.</p><hr/><p><b>Yoda</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Awesome, it was.</p><hr/><p><b>Yice Frey</b> <a href="mailto:Lfrey@houston.rr.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>That movie was exellent!

I am forced to listen to Hayden smash his way through the worst dialogue possibly ever written. Yoda vs the Emperor, give me a break that was just plain uncalled for and silly to watch at best. The Emperor who is a grande character is reduced to a laughing stock in this film. General Grievous may have possibly been the silliest thing I have ever seen in a sci-fi film, a coughing robot! The scenes between Padme and Skywalker were some of the worst dialogue I have ever read. CGI effects do not impress me and never have. No matter how digital and awesome they get I can still tell it's cartoonish, am I the only one?. Now the scenes of Darth Vader finally coming to life were brilliant. The Emperors line "can you hear me Lord Vader" brought me back to childhood and my love of Star Wars was restored, until the voice of James Earl was abused for the final time with the silliest lines ever. The characters sullied by the dialogue. I know they say "well let's see you do a better job with it you armchair fanboy". You know what, my cat Smoky could have written a better script. It practically writes itself now and Lucas still messed it up. Thanks for the original trilogy Lucas, this new trilogy was not needed and it mostly sucked badly.

It's clear to me that you don't pay attention. Just because it's the final installment doesn't mean it has to have mind blowing sceens. Also of course you're not going to see Darth Vader until the last minutes of the movie you ass clown. Revenge of the Sith is the story of Anakin choosing his destiny, over himself and the survival of his wife. His choices confuse him and break him down, beautifully done if I say so myself. So news for you "Jesse", if the movie is so bad then I would like to see you with a goddamn camera and make it better, ummmm!

Don't think so!</p><hr/><p><b>Landon</b> <img src="/images/rating/2-stars.gif"/> (2 out of 10 )<br/>I'm not sure why people call this the best one yet. Yes, it COULD and SHOULD have been the best one yet. The story that needed to be told SHOULD have been the best story, but the way Lucas did it was lame.
Brandon, I don't think George Lucas took a camera and went out and shot a movie. He had over 100 million dollars and a giant crew to do this. And it doesn't matter if it was complete trash, if it's Star Wars, the fan base is big enough that people are going to go see it no matter what. I'm an aspiring film maker/screenwriter and if I was given the Star Wars trilogy I could have done a better job. Not because I'm full of myself, but CGI effects aren't what it's all about. The only reason you should use CGI is to help tell the story. He did it to beat Lord of the Rings (which he didn't and will never do).

All in all this was a pretty good movie, if it was just another movie. But it wasn't. We've been waiting for this link since the original came out and the last three movies have been just lame CGI*o*rama movies that had no character build up, just a background story and that's it.

George Lucas thinks that because he created three good movies in his life time that he's set and that people will like this crap because of all the CGI effects. That's not why we liked the first ones, George! We liked the first ones because it was something we'd never seen before, it was a great story and better than anything of that day in time. Not because it was a CGI breakthrough! </p><hr/><p><b>Joel</b> <a href="mailto:jimdebfrench@cableone.net" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>I love Episode 3 it's the best movie ever!</p><hr/><p><b>Snaitf Kenobi</b> <a href="mailto:pippin@webvana.mcm.edu" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>GREVIOUS IS NOT A COUGHING ROBOT! He is a KALEESH who almost got killed in a ship crash so they saved him by making him part-robot. In fact, if you ARTARDS had bothered to look you could see his eyes in the closeup in the Obi/Grevious fight! They're real eyes, not robot eyes. And his lungs were permanently damaged in the crash, and THAT'S why he coughs. Even my brother got that, and he's... well, he's due home any minute now, so I'd better not say ^_^. But I don't see why people don't like this. I thought it was awesome. And why do people think that Yoda/Palpatine fight. Have you seen the OT lately? Definitely an improvement. Besides, if you don't like the script, why don't you try and make it yourself? (And no stealing lines, because then it's not original!). Not very easy is it? I mean think about it: any time you write something, SOMEONE is going to hate it and if it's as highly anticipated as a Star Wars film then a lot of people are going to hate it, even if it's friggin Shakespeare simply for the fact that they aren't open-minded enough to even try to enjoy it! I mean writing is harder than you think, especially for epic movies like this. And if you thought this was a bad script, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE FREAKIN CORE?! That was the worst script I have ever seen, it was like a 2 year old was writing it! Bleh! Anyways, don't be offended if I wailed on you, I just loved this movie and I hate it when people criticize things for no reason. Especially when the reason they don't like it is obviously wrong. Coughing robot, HONESTLY... (Rolls eyes). Anyways, I still love this movie, I especially loved the deleted scene with Ani and Obi using secret symbols.

Yeah sure she probably still could have lived because she had no physical injuries but it was the emotional injuries that caused her to die. She couldn't believe that Anakin did all those horrible things and that he changed just because of her. The romance of the movie of course played a big part of Anakin's downfall but I think its the fact that he 'died' for Padme just liked Jack did for Rose in Titanic. Although the other half of the relationship (meaning the female) didn't die in Titanic. So I'm not the kind of person to give this movie a really low rating but things that this make people see another side even though that person still thinks the movie is 10/10.</p><hr/><p><b>Alan</b> <img src="/images/rating/2-stars.gif"/> (2 out of 10 )<br/>A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away there was a superb trilogy of movies called Star Wars, which captured the imagination of millions of people and changed the film industry forever. Two decades later their creator George "The Force" Lucas decided firstly to start pointlessly messing around with the originals and then came up with a project for a trilogy of prequels, secretly titled "The Search for More Money". This caused great excitement among fans of the original movies, resulting in the sale of much branded merchandise, even before the first prequel had been seen. Unfortunately, this first film "The Phantom Menace" turned out to be crap, being notable only for the introduction of possibly the most irritating character in movie history, Jar Jar Binks, who instantly soared to the top of all true fans' death lists. Relatively undaunted the fanbase consoled themselves with the thought that things could only get better in the next installment. Indeed so powerful was the wish for an improvement that some people actually convinced themselves they had witnessed just such a pickup in quality when the second film "Attack of the Clones" was finally released. Sadly they were deluding themselves, as this second film was in fact even crapper than the first. But what the heck, it still made money so the project was still on track. Then came the third and most crucial installment, the one which would link all the story strands from the prequels into the originals. Surely, everyone said, the almighty Lucas can't bollocks this one up. How wrong they were. "Revenge of the Sith" turns out to be easily the crappest of all the Star Wars movies. The dialogue is quite incredibly stilted, while the central "romance" of Anakin and Padme feels as flaccid as a fillet of haddock. The notion that he becomes the most evil guy in the galaxy just to save her, is about as convincing as a chain letter for a Nigerian pyramid scheme. Equally risible is the idea that she then dies of nothing other than a broken heart. Meanwhile, the CGI effects sequences are even more cartoonish and interminable than ever before. In fact at times it doesn't seem like a movie at all. Rather it feels like being forced to watch another person (i. E. George Lucas) playing a video game and few things are more tedious than that. Simply put the Star Wars prequels are all turkeys- turkeys that are now well and truly stuffed with money gobbled up from cinema goers and DVD buyers. A long time ago I along with millions of others, imagined a back story to Star Wars that was a damn-site more interesting than any of these prequels. Now I'll just have to try and forget I ever saw them.</p><hr/><p><b>Jonathan</b> <a href="mailto:winterbreeze182010@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Mr. Lucas has captured our hearts over the past thirty years and the last prequel to A NEW HOPE is the best by far.

I say that this is the best of all the 6 movies.</p><hr/><p><b>Den</b> <a href="mailto:jo@optusnet.com.au" title="E-mail User"><img border="0" src="/images/emailuser.gif"/></a>   <img src="/images/rating/7-stars.gif"/> (7 out of 10 )<br/>Yeah, I think the movie was alright but what is it with Master Yoda? I mean the guy walks with a cane but when he has a light sabre in his hands he is so energetic. Anyway the film was pretty good Lucas. You're a talented director and may the force be with you!</p><hr/><p><b>slave boy</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Yoda walks with a cane because he can't support himself but he calls on the Force to do battles. Did any of you out there see the most popular star wars character list? Anakin is listed like ninth and obi-wan didn't even make the cut, that sucks.</p><hr/><p><b>Ryan</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>I really enjoy the Star Wars movies. I even missed out on my senior prom just to go and watch this movie with my mom.</p><hr/><p><b>unpleasable</b> <img src="/images/rating/5-stars.gif"/> (5 out of 10 )<br/>This movie could be better. Take the windu death scene. One second, anakin's an innocent spectator, then he cuts off windu's arm, then he's like, oh crap, what have I done? Then suddenly, it's yipee, I'm lord vader. The name sucks but hey who cares. Average film, but worthy of a saga ending.</p><hr/><p><b>feendeezy</b> <img src="/images/rating/8-stars.gif"/> (8 out of 10 )<br/>Why are all the people who criticize lucas' writing ability in such desperate need of a spell and grammar checker?
Lucas is a billionaire, you write poorly on message boards. Who is the winner in that scenario?        </p><hr/><p><b>The Senate</b> <img src="/images/rating/10-stars.gif"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"? It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... The only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</p><hr/></td>
